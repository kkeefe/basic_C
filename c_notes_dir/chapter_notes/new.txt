We're looking for people who're interested in smaller FC's who want to play with a core group of people! I can say that the best part of the game for me is having played with the same people everyday so when I log on, I know I have people I can rely on for hunts / Main story quest progression / map parties / raids / roulettes / decorating houses with / chatting with about life etc..

If you're interested in this kind of friendly and helpful group and want to learn more feel free to apply to Grace of Demons FC or better yet:

/tell Papahuhu Mamahuhu (maybe you've seen me!)

I can tank / heal if you have those long dps queues.. You can also

/tell some other leaders if I'm not on!
/tell Koko Ala'ikea or
/tell Yellow Skies
/tell Maxy Powers
/tell Feit Enders
We'd love to meet you!
