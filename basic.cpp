  //exercise 11.5
  //explaine the differeneces between map and set, when would you use each?


  //exercise 11.6
  //explain the difference between a set and list, when would you use each?
  
  //exercise 11.7
  //define a map for which the key is the family's last name and the value is a vector of strings.
  //write code to add new families and to add new chidlren to an existing family

  //exercise 11.8
  //write a program that stores the excluded words in a vector instead of in a set,
  //what are the advantages to useing a set??

  //exercise 11.9
  //define a map that associates words with a list of line numbers on which the word might occur

  //exercise 11.10
  //could we define a map from vector<int>::ioterator in int?
  //what about list<int>::iterator to int> in each case, if not, why not?

  //exercise 11.11
  //redefine bookstore without using decltype

  //exercise 11.12
  //write a program to read a sequence of strings and ints, storing each into a pair. store the pairs in a vector.

  //exercise 11.13
  //there are at lest 3 ways to create a pair. create a pair in 3 different ways. which is the best?

  //exercise 11.14
  //extend the map of children to their fmaily name that you wrote by having the vector store a pair that hold's a child's name and birthday..

  //exercise 11.15
  //what are the mapped_type, key_type, and value_type of a map from int to vector<int>?

  //exercise 11.16
  //using a map iterator write an expression that assigns a value to an element.

  //exercise 11.17
  //explain which of the following calls are legal on page 431..

  //exercise 11.18
  //write the type of map_it from the loop on page 430 without using decltype..

  //exercise 11.19
  //define a variable that you initialie by calling begin() no the multiset name bookstore from page 425.
  //write the variable's type without using auto of decltype.

  //exercise 11.20
  //write the word counting program on page 421 to use insert instead of subscripting.
  //which is the easier / better program to write and why?

  //exercise 11.21
  //assuming word_count is a mpa from string to size_t, and word is a string explain the following loop:
  /*
    while (cin >> word)
    ++word_count.insert({word,0}.first->second;
   */
  
  //exercise 11.22
  //given a map<string, vector<int>> write the types used as an argument and as a return value for the version of insert that inserts one element.

  //exercise 11.23
  //rewrite the map that stored vectors of children's names with a key that is the family last name for the exercises on page 424, to use a multimap
