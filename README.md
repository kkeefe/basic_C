basic_C

Where I store update c code that I'm working on for either basic practice or storing useful functions / classes currently under development..


1) difference between TH1F fill(x,y) vs. SetBinContent

2) TSpline method

3) TBrowser fit

4) find divergence of noise with residual fit

5) boxcar fit to find max value of where we think max "gaus" fit should be, find threshold

6) residual fits
